# Real-Time Smoking Detection System
# Overview
In this project, I  developed  a real-time smoking detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. The goal was to create a solution for identifying smoking patterns in real-time scenarios.

# Methodology
CNN Model Training: Employed the powerful VGG16 architecture for training the CNN model. The model was fine-tuned to achieve an impressive accuracy of approximately 84.75%, indicating its capability to discern smoking patterns accurately.

Real-Time Implementation: Integrated OpenCV into the system to enable seamless real-time detection of smoking incidents.
